<h3 id="overview-of-the-babylogger">Overview of the BabyLogger</h3>
<p>The BabyLogger is a device used by researchers to record a child’s interactions in a secure manner and to extract the audio and actimetric information.</p>
<h4 id="components">Components</h4>
<p>The device consists of two parts: a main body and a cover. Removing the cover allows for access to the SD card, and power port (micro USB). The following pictures shows the main components of the BabyLogger:</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-babylogger">How to use the BabyLogger</h3>
<p>The BabyLogger is very simple to use. It has a single button used to <em>power on</em> the logger (short press) and to turn it off (long press). The different states of the BabyLogger are indicated via two LEDs:  <span class="greenText"><strong>GREEN</strong> </span> and  <span class="redText"><strong>RED</strong> </span> (for all the LED states <a href="#step-1-starting-the-babylogger">see Step 1</a>).</p>
<p>The BabyLogger has a 24 hour continuous recording capacity (for both battery and data). After each recording session, you should transfer the data to your computer through the SD card, delete all files on the SD card, and recharge your BabyLogger.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-positioning-the-logger-for-recording">Step 2. Positioning the Logger for Recording</h4>
<p>With the <span class="greenText"><strong>GREEN LED</strong> </span> LED continuously lit, the BabyLogger is now in the recording phase. (If the <span class="redText"><strong>RED LED</strong> </span>  is blinking, the battery is low).</p>
<p>To use the BabyLogger for recording, first ensure the cover is on before inserting the logger into the chest pocket of the participant.</p>
<!-- Insert the BabyLogger in the chest pocket with the top of the cover facing up, and the three microphones in the front facing out. -->
<p>When placing the logger, make sure that the the top of the cover faces upwards and that the front with the green light and other 3 microphones is on the front and faces away from the chest. The images below show how to correctly position the logger and insert it in the pocket:</p>
<p><div class="docImage two">

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</p>
<h4 id="step-3-turning-off-the-logger">Step 3. Turning off the logger</h4>
<p>When you have completed your session, turn off the BabyLogger by holding the power button (long press, 3 seconds). <strong>All LEDs</strong> should be <strong>off</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-transferring-recordings">Step 4. Transferring recordings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove the cover and push in the SD card to pop it out. Be careful: the SD card may shoot out of the slot and can be easily lost &ndash; it is tiny.</li>
<li>Put the SD card in a MicroSD adaptor and plug it into a computer.</li>
<li>Boot your computer (for software installation <a href="/#decrypting-the-data">see here</a>), drag and drop the files from both partitions on the MicroSD (BL_MOTION and BL_AUDIO) into the Raw_Data folder on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<div class="warning">
    <h5>WARNING</h5>
    
<p>Be careful, if using more than one logger, transfer and decrypt the first logger’s raw files before transferring the second logger’s raw files. All loggers use the same file name pattern, therefore you will overwrite the first logger’s raw files if they are not decrypted before transferring files from the second logger.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="step-5-decrypting-the-recordings">Step 5. Decrypting the recordings</h4>
<p>To decrypt the files, follow the <a href="/#decrypting-the-data">decrypt process</a>.</p>
<h4 id="step-6-charging-the-logger">Step 6. Charging the logger</h4>
<p>Remove the logger’s cover. Plug the micro USB end of the charging cord into the logger’s Micro USB port. Plug the USB end into any computer USB port or phone charger with a USB port. To avoid damaging the battery, make sure the voltage of the charger is no higher than 5V. For a normal charging time, ensure the current capacity is between 1A and 2A.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">
    <b>Note: </b>
You can use a USB/ Micro-USB cable to charge the Logger with any standard charger (or computer).

</div>

<p>The <span class="greenText"><strong>GREEN</strong> </span> and  <span class="redText"><strong>RED</strong> </span> <strong>LEDs</strong> blink steadily while the logger is charging. Once the device is fully charged, both LEDs will turn off. The device will turn itself off automatically. The logger takes 2-3 hours to fully charge.</p>
<div class="warning">
    <h5>WARNING</h5>
    
<ul>
  <li>While the logger is charging, it is not possible to record.</li>
  <li>Once the logger has been fully charged, the device must be used at least once before it will be able to charge again. This is for power saving purposes designed to prevent the logger from draining portable external batteries.</li>
  <li>To avoid losing data, we strongly recommend following step 1 to step 5 through fully, without skipping any steps. Most importantly, remember to fully transfer the data and recharge the logger after each recording session.</li>
